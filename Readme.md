HELLO!!!


- The program must be saved into the R working directory. (getwd())
- Note that the file references are made with "/" and not "\" (Linux R) so if run in windows, not sure if it will work.
- Inside the working directory must be placed the /"UCI HAR Dataset" directory 
- The resulting merged files are into a directory called "merged"" inside the /"UCI HAR Dataset" directory named in the same way than the originals test and train sets

- The tidy data sets are stored in the working directory in txt format (CVS) called "tidydata_1_to_4.txt" for the questions from 1 to 4 and "tidydata_5.txt" for answering wuestion number 5

- The R script explains the data process procedure step by step.
